# soundboardApp


# Overview

This is a basic soundboard app made in Android Studio. Even though the app contains a few sounds, 
it is able to play a sound the user selects without looping. The purpose of the app is to demonstrate a single feature, 
in this case SoundPool (an importable Android Studio tool for sounds), in an Android app.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Andorid Studio, and the types of programming I used includes:
* Kotlin
* XML file
* [SoundPool](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/SoundPool)
* .wav files

Kotlin was important for having the outline for how the app works. The XML file in the program
took the Kotlin file, I added buttons and contraints to make the buttons work. The application SoundPool was able to add
the sounds with the .wav files.
